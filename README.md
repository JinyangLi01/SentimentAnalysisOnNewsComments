# SentimentAnalysisOnNewsComments
Goal: sentimental analyze based on news comments

Material: News comments about amour between the Han Lu and Xiaotong Guan (famous actor/actress in China). The volume of comments about this peace of news was so large that it led to a rare breakdown of Weibo’s servers. So many fans commented on Han Lu’s new love affair that the social media platform was inaccessible for two hours. See details in https://www.whatsonweibo.com/weibo-servers-lu-han-announces-new-relationship/.

Two methods: 
1. Directory method
2. Mechine Learning method

Results:
Directory method has a precision about 2/3, higher than 50% but not good. The main reason is the lack of logic in many comments (from crazy and disappointed fans).
Machine Learning method has a precision about ??.
